The aim of this talk was to explain some nitty gritty details of how eBPF works a
CNCF meetup in Innsbruck.

I have to say I went a bit overboard with the details and lost half of the audience
during the talk. Oops!

The talk ended with an sample on a deep dive how the container drift detection in
Kvisor (Cast.AIs eBPF sensor) works.

Sadly no recording is available for the talk.

You can find roughly what I said though in my Github [repo](https://github.com/patrickpichler/of_bees_and_runtime_security/blob/main/talk.md).
