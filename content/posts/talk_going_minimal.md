In this talk I explored how to build minimal container images for a small sample application.

We started out by using a simple, but inefficient Dockerfile and worked our way through to
advanced solutions such as Distroless and Chainguards Apko/Melange.

Sadly there is no recording of the talk.

You can find the spoken text though in my Github [repo](https://github.com/patrickpichler/going-minimal/blob/main/talk.md).
